Track Definition 
Objective: The goal of this track is to create an intelligent Agent that can automate the testing 
process by analyzing application requirements and Figma designs. The Agent will generate a 
comprehensive test plan, develop test cases, and automate their execution, ensuring seamless 
integration with CI/CD pipelines. 
Scope: 
• Analyze and understand application requirements. 
• Interpret Figma designs to extract functional and UI-related test cases. 
• Develop a structured test plan covering all critical aspects. 
• Generate detailed test cases to validate application functionality. 
• Automate the execution of test cases using suitable frameworks. 
• Ensure that automated tests can be integrated with CI/CD tools for continuous testing. 
Expected Outcomes: 
• A robust test plan covering all key functionalities. 
• Well-structured manual and automated test cases. 
• Automation scripts capable of executing tests efficiently. 
• Seamless CI/CD integration for automated test execution. 
Technology Stack: 
• Test Automation Frameworks: Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, etc. 
• CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, etc. 
• Scripting Languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, etc. 
• Design Analysis: Figma API (if required for automated extraction). 
Evaluation Criteria: 
• Accuracy and completeness of the test plan. 
• Efficiency of generated test cases. 
• The success rate of automated test execution. 
• Integration capability with CI/CD pipelines. 
• Scalability and adaptability of the Agent.
